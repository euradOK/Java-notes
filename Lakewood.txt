Say Like you mean it,
This is my Bible,
I am what it says i am,
I have what it says i have,
I can do what it says i can do,
Today i will talk the word of God,
I boldlyconfess,
My mind is an alert,my heart is receiptive 
I will never be the same. in Jesus name. Amen

Lord Jesus,
I repent my sin,
Come into my heart,
I will make my Lord and my saviour.
